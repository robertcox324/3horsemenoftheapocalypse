E-xtract:
Our original data sources for this project were the MovieLens movie rating datasets available at
https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ (ml-20m.zip) which were all in csv format
and twitter data in json format accessed through their developer api.

T-ransform:
The movie data sets were accessed with movies.csv, tags.csv, and ratings.csv, with relevant
data from each combined. Joining on movieId, title and genre of the movie were taken from
movies.csv, timestamp from tags.csv was used to parse the year of the movie, and rating was
taken from ratings.csv. After the combined movies table was formed with movieId, title, 
genres, year, and rating, first we had to remove the year in "(yyyy)" format from the end 
of the title column entries. After that, we removed all empty spaces from the titles, added a
# sign in front of each result, and put all of that into its own new hashtag column in the 
movies dataframe. Finally, we narrowed our selection of movies down based on the following conditions:
The movies selected were all movies from 1990 onwards, with genres of "animation" or "fantasy" and
an average rating greater than or equal to 4 stars. We then used those hashtags we created to access 
twitter and find a relevant comment for each movie. A twitter dataframe was created with hashtag 
primary key, and columns for username, user location, and tweet text.

L-oad:
The final SQL database has two tables. Movies has columns of movieID (primary key), title, genre, 
release year, average rating, and hashtag. Twitter has columns of hashtag (primary key), tweet, 
user location, and userID. These tables were chosen to be easily joinable on hashtag, to put a 
tweet's text next to a movie's rating and other relevant information.
